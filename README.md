94 Percent Of India'S It Graduates Are Not Fit For Hiring: Tech Mahindra Ceo


In a study by employability assessment company Aspiring Minds in 2018, only 4.77 percent of candidates can write the correct logic for a programme â€” a minimum requirement for any programming job. More than 95% of the engineers in the country were not fit for the software development jobs.



CP Gurnani, CEO of Tech Mahindra says that 94% of IT graduates are not eligible for jobs in Indian IT companies. He added that the top 10 IT companies hire only 4-5% of the total engineering graduates then what happens to the rest 95%?



Gurnani said, "Let me give you an example from a city like Delhi. A student scoring 60% marks cannot pursue BA-English today but can definitely go in for engineering. My point is simple are we not creating people for unemployment," he said adding, "The point is if I am looking for a robotics person and instead, I get a mainframe person, then it creates a skill gap. This comes as a big challenge."
